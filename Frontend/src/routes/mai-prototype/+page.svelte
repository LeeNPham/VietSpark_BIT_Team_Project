	<h2> About the Engineer</h2>
	<p>
		🌱 Hi, my name is Mai (they/them) I’m a software engineer/returning graduate at Techtonica with a 
		passion for creating accessible features for people with disabilities. 
		<br /><br />
		As someone who has a disability (i.e. being recently diagnosed with ADHD) -- I 
		I have a difficult time focusing on tasks without constant visual reminders. 
		I could never get into the habit of using a planner because I would 
		forget about it's existence. 
		<br /><br /> 		
		So, in a few weeks, you (the user) will be able to see a task tracker that also 
		allows you to set reminders with alerts sent to your email or phone.
